<a id="forkme_banner" href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram">View Full Source on GitHub</a>

<p>The very first full Java application created in this portfolio. It was designed to provide a UI for configuring a digital election ballot, then generating that digital ballot based on the user input. It was created a mere two months into the process of learning the language, and while it's a bit crude, it also demonstrates a remarkable talent for rapidly learning and applying new concepts. Nearly everything in this program was a first attempt at implementing a major concept in the language, and it all comes together and succeeds in creating a very effective program.</p>

<h2>Key Components</h2>

<h3>Rich and Diverse GUI</h3>

<p>A great effort was made to use a wide range of <code>Swing</code> components and layouts, an exploration of all that Java's UI tools had to offer.</p>

<h4>Examples in Code:</h4>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th id="class">Class/Interface</th>
		<th id="description">Description</th>
		<th id="links">Links</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">BCMainEditorPanel</td>
		<td headers="description">The main panel in the frame, containing a list of items already created for the ballot and buttons to open the various editors.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/ballotcreator/BCMainEditorPanel.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">BCInnerOfficePanel</td>
		<td headers="description">One of the many editor panels, this one to create/edit elected offices for the ballot.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/ballotcreator/BCInnerOfficePanel.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Customized List for Data Storage</h3>

<p>An early attempt to repurpose one of Java's core interfaces for a custom implementation. This custom <code>List</code> class combines both the temporary storage and tools to save and load the data from the disk. It also serves as a critical bridge to pass information between the various components of the program.</p>

<h4>Examples in Code:</h4>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th id="class">Class/Interface</th>
		<th id="description">Description</th>
		<th id="links">Links</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">BallotDataList</td>
		<td headers="description">A crude, modified <code>List</code> class with special methods that are tailored for the specific elements of the ballot. Also includes IO methods for saving state to file.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/data/BallotDataList.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Construct New GUI Based on User Input</h3>

<p>The primary function of this program is to provide an interface for configuring an election ballot, and then generating the ballot based on that configuration. The ballot displays in a separate window, and assembles itself based on the options set by the creator part of the program.</p>

<h4>Examples in Code:</h4>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th id="class">Class/Interface</th>
		<th id="description">Description</th>
		<th id="links">Links</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">Ballot</td>
		<td headers="description">The base class for the generated ballot, which parses the configuration data to determine how to be assembled.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/ballot/Ballot.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
