I need to invoke it on my machine via a command. However, with a single command it will scan the project, identify which type of project it is, validate the configuration, build, test, and deploy it. It is the heart of my current home infrastructure, and one day I may take the final steps and convert it into a proper CI/CD."]}],a=[...i],h=()=>{const t=a;return e.jsx(o,{title:"Project Build System (aka 'craig-build')",documentation:t})};export{h as CraigBuild};
