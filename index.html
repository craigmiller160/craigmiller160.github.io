<p>I am a programming enthusiast with nearly a year of hands-on coding experience, primarily in Java and SQL. I find personal enjoyment in working on challenging projects simply to see what I can ultimately accomplish. In addition to a few small courses, I've learned most of what I know through self-teaching, reading tutorials and lots of source code. Ultimately, I've learned the most by writing code myself. Planning ambitious, complex projects and then slowly working out the issues and obstacles along the way,  I've gained a deep understanding of how the languages I work with operate. I've created this page to show off the work that I've done, to demonstrate the skills that I've gained from it. All the projects listed here were designed, planned, coded, and tested by me personally.</p>

<h2>My Projects</h2>

<p>I've worked on dozens of coding projects, most of them small experiments that weren't even worth uploading to my GitHub. Highlighted here is a showcase of my best work. Personal libraries and APIs and fully-composed programs that I built, mostly just for fun. Each one demonstrates skills that I've learned from my experience.</p>

<h3><a href="stockmarket.html">Stock Market (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A stock market simulation program that utilizes real-time market data from Yahoo! Finance. Concurrent, with industry standard design patterns, database access, multi-lingual, and more.</p>

<h3><a href="mvpframework.html">MVP Framework (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A fully constructed framework that programs can be built around using the Model View Presenter pattern. Near-total separation of concerns, advanced reflection, and safe concurrency are some of the key features of this project.</p>

<h3><a href="currency.html">Money and Currency Conversion (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A simple library for utilizing amounts of money of different currencies. Amounts of money can have an operation performed on them, even if they have different currency types. Automatic conversions with rates from Yahoo! Finance preserve the consistency of the values.</p>



<h3><a href="inverted.html">TS-Inverted Apps</a></h3>

<p>My oldest project, an installer script for themed Android apps, created in partnership with the app theme developers. It is coded in "Edify", the Android installer scripting language.</p>

<h3><a href="ballot.html">Ballot Program</a></h3>

<p>My first ever completely designed and built Java program. A bit rough around the edges, but it still manages to have a sophisticated UI, save its state via IO, and respond dynamically to user input.

<p><b><u>Key Components:</u></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fully assembled GUI in Swing</li>
	<li>IO processes to save/load the program's state to a file.</li>
	<li>Generates a fully assembled secondary window UI based on configuration chosen by the user.</li>
</ul>
