<p>I am a programming enthusiast with nearly a year of hands-on coding experience, primarily in Java and SQL. I find personal enjoyment in working on challenging projects simply to see what I can ultimately accomplish. In addition to a few small courses, I've learned most of what I know through self-teaching, reading tutorials and lots of source code. Ultimately, I've learned the most by writing code myself. Planning ambitious, complex projects and then slowly working out the issues and obstacles along the way,  I've gained a deep understanding of how the languages I work with operate. I've created this page to show off the work that I've done, to demonstrate the skills that I've gained from it. All the projects listed here were designed, planned, coded, and tested by me personally.</p>

<h2>My Projects</h2>

<p>I've worked on dozens of coding projects, most of them small experiments that weren't even worth uploading to my GitHub. Highlighted here is a showcase of my best work. Personal libraries and APIs and fully-composed programs that I built, mostly just for fun. Each one demonstrates skills that I've learned from my experience.</p>

<h3><a href="stockmarket.html">Stock Market</a></h3>

<p>A stock market simulation program that utilizes real-time market data from Yahoo! Finance. Concurrent, with industry standard design patterns, database access, multi-lingual, and more.</p>

<h3><a href="mvpframework.html">MVP Framework</a></h3>

<p>A fully constructed framework that programs can be built around using the Model View Presenter pattern. Near-total separation of concerns, advanced reflection, and safe concurrency are some of the key features of this project.</p>

<h3>Money and Currency Conversion</h3>

<p>What started as my first experiment with accessing a web based service and retrieving information transformed into a pretty awesome little library. It ties <code>BigDecimal</code> values to currency types, which enables a number of special operations. Essentially it allows amounts of money of various currency types to be compared, combined, and otherwise operated on by a program.</p>

<p><b><u>Key Components:</u></b></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>Money</code> objects must always have a <code>BigDecimal</code> value and a <code>CurrentyType</code>. Any change to the type results in a conversion operation on the value.</li>
	<li>Objects of different currency types can be used together in mathematical operations (add/subtract/multiply/divide), which will automatically perform the necessary conversions to produce the correct result.</li>
	<li>Amounts of money with different currency types can be compared to one another, using the <code>Comparable</code> interface and propper conversions.</li>
	<li>Currency conversion rates are downloaded when needed from Yahoo! Finance.</li>
	<li>Currently supports 24 different currency types, but could easily support all currency types, so long as the <code>enum</code> constant values conform to the <code>ISO4217</code> standard.</li>
</ul>

<h3>TS-Inverted Apps</h3>

<p>My oldest project, doesn't use Java or SQL but "Edify", a special scripting language used for Android installer scripts. This script is designed to install a series of themed versions of popular Android apps, and was developed in cooperation with the theme developers. It utilizes the Android <code>Aroma Installer</code> (from developer Amarulz) to provide the user with a simple interface to select which apps to install, defining a series of properties files along the way. It then executes the installation process based on the items the properties files indicate were selected. Unfortuantely, I had to abandon this project when my work at the time became too busy for me to continue it.</p>

<p><b><u>Key Components:</u></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Option to do a full <code>GApps</code> installation along with installing the specified apps.</li>
	<li>Full slate of <code>TeamBlackout</code> themed apps.</li>
	<li><code>Aroma Installer</code> gives the user the ability to pick and choose which apps to install.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ballot Program</h3>

<p>My very first full Java application. A UI, action logic, IO, and everything in between. It's a bit on the crude side, and poorly documented as well, but I felt like it was a good thing to put here to demonstrate just how far I've come. Moreover, I built this after just two months of studying the language, and it utilizes a wide range of Java features, which is a testament to my ability to rapidly learn new concepts. The program's purpose is to generate a digital ballot, based on user input through a ballot configuration UI.</p>

<p><b><u>Key Components:</u></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fully assembled GUI in Swing</li>
	<li>IO processes to save/load the program's state to a file.</li>
	<li>Generates a fully assembled secondary window UI based on configuration chosen by the user.</li>
</ul>
