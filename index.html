<h2>The Projects</h2>

<p>A year of writing code can produce a great many products. With a focus on taking on new and unique challenges, this programming portfolio quickly grew. Highlighted here is a selection of the work produced: personal libraries and APIs, frameworks, and fully composed programs. Each project here was chosen to demonstrate key skills developed in their creation. They were all completly planned, coded, tested, and published independently.</p>

<h3><a href="schoolportal.html">School Portal Web App (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A demo Java web application, providing a system for administrators to register courses and students to sign up for them for a high school. Built around the Spring & Hibernate frameworks, deployed in the Tomcat web server, internationalized, with JSP views and Bootstrap UI components.</p>

<h3><a href="stockmarket.html">Stock Market (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A stock market simulation program that utilizes real-time market data from Yahoo! Finance. Safely concurrent, with industry standard design patterns, database access, internationalized, and more.</p>

<h3><a href="mvpframework.html">MVP Framework (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A fully constructed framework that programs can be built around using the Model View Presenter pattern. Near-total separation of concerns, advanced reflection, and safe concurrency are some of the key features of this project.</p>

<h3><a href="currency.html">Money and Currency Conversion (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A simple library for utilizing amounts of money of different currencies. Amounts of money can have an operation performed on them, even if they have different currency types. Automatic conversions with rates from Yahoo! Finance preserve the consistency of the values.</p>

<h3><a href="inverted.html">TS-Inverted Apps</a></h3>

<p>An older project, not in either Java or SQL but "Edify", the Android installer script. It's a program designed to install themed apps on an Android device, created in partnership with the app theme developers.</p>

<h3><a href="ballot.html">Ballot Program</a></h3>

<p>The first complete application ever produced by this developer. It is an application designed to configure a digital election ballot, and ultimately display the ballot based on that configuration. Composed with only a mere two months of experience, it's a bit rough around the edges, but also a great demonstration of the ability of the developer to quickly learn and apply new concepts.</p>
