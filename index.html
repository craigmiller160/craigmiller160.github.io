<p>I am a programming enthusiast with nearly a year of hands-on coding experience in Java and SQL. In addition to a few small courses, I've learned most of what I know through self-teaching and reading tutorials, javadocs, and lots of source code. Ultimately, I've learned the most by writing code myself. I plan ambitious, complex projects to test myself and my skills, and find excitement in overcoming obstacles and finding creative solutions. This process has given me a deep understanding of how the languages I work with operate. I've created this page to show off the work that I've done, to demonstrate the skills that I've gained from it. All the projects listed here were designed, planned, coded, and tested by me personally.</p>

<h2>My Projects</h2>

<p>I've worked on quite a few projects over the past year. My focus is always on pushing myself to tackle concepts that will challenge me and force me to expand my skillset. Highlighted here is a showcase of my best work. Personal libraries, APIs, and fully-composed programs, all created to test myself and push my skills to the next level. Each project here was chosen to demonstrate skills that I've learned from my experience.</p>

<h3><a href="stockmarket.html">Stock Market (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A stock market simulation program that utilizes real-time market data from Yahoo! Finance. Concurrent, with industry standard design patterns, database access, multi-lingual, and more.</p>

<h3><a href="mvpframework.html">MVP Framework (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A fully constructed framework that programs can be built around using the Model View Presenter pattern. Near-total separation of concerns, advanced reflection, and safe concurrency are some of the key features of this project.</p>

<h3><a href="currency.html">Money and Currency Conversion (w/ JavaDoc)</a></h3>

<p>A simple library for utilizing amounts of money of different currencies. Amounts of money can have an operation performed on them, even if they have different currency types. Automatic conversions with rates from Yahoo! Finance preserve the consistency of the values.</p>

<h3><a href="inverted.html">TS-Inverted Apps</a></h3>

<p>My oldest project, an installer script for themed Android apps, created in partnership with the app theme developers. It is coded in "Edify", the Android installer scripting language.</p>

<h3><a href="ballot.html">Ballot Program</a></h3>

<p>The first complete application I ever designed and built. It is an application designed to configure a digital election ballot, and ultimately display the ballot based on that configuration. It was composed a mere two months after I started learning Java, and while it's a bit rough around the edges it's a great demonstration of how quickly I can learn and apply a wide range of concepts.</p>
