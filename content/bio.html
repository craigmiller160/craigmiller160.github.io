            <p>Craig Miller is a <span class="craig-age"></span> year old software developer living and working in Tampa, Florida. He brings a detail-focused, object-oriented approach to development, and has experience with multiple languages. His training came from a combination of online courses, self teaching, and a passion for developing software on his own.</p>
            
            <p>At a young age, Craig's family strongly supported and encouraged his development work. Both his father and uncle had achieved a great deal of success as software developers, and they instilled in him from a young age a passion for technology. While Craig didn't pursue Computer Science in College, after graduation he discovered that was where his passion truly lay.</p>
            
            <p>Today, Craig works as a Java Developer for a Tampa-based firm. Outside of work, however, he continues to expand his skillset with a wide variety of personal projects in various languages.</p>
