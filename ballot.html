<a id="forkme_banner" href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram">View Full Source on GitHub</a>

<p>My very first full Java application, designed provide a UI for configuring a digital election ballot, and then generating that digital ballot based on the user input. There are so many "firsts" in this project it would take forever to list them all. First fully composed GUI, first time using listeners, first time storing program state via IO, the list goes on. I built this after just two months of studying the language, and while it can be a bit rough at times, I can look at this code and literally see how I was evolving as a developer.</p>

<h2>Key Components</h2>

<h3>Rich and Diverse GUI</h3>

<p>This was my first real GUI program, so I put effort into using a wide range of <code>Swing</code> components and layouts.</p>

<h4>Examples in Code:</h4>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th id="class">Class/Interface</th>
		<th id="description">Description</th>
		<th id="links">Links</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">BCMainEditorPanel</td>
		<td headers="description">The main panel in the frame, containing a list of items already created for the ballot and buttons to open the various editors.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/ballotcreator/BCMainEditorPanel.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">BCInnerOfficePanel</td>
		<td headers="description">One of the many editor panels, this one to create/edit elected offices for the ballot.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/ballotcreator/BCInnerOfficePanel.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Customized List for Data Storage</h3>

<p>My first attempt to take one of Java's core interfaces and provide my own implementation. This custom <code>List</code> class, complete with IO loading/saving logic, is more than a little crude. However, the lessons I learned from working on this class gave me the foundation to begin expanding my exploration of Java's core library classes, and how I could specialize them through inheritence.</p>

<h4>Examples in Code:</h4>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th id="class">Class/Interface</th>
		<th id="description">Description</th>
		<th id="links">Links</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">BallotDataList</td>
		<td headers="description">A crude, modified <code>List</code> class with special methods that are tailored for the specific elements of the ballot. Also includes IO methods for saving state to file.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/data/BallotDataList.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Construct New GUI Based on User Input</h3>

<p>The primary function of this program is to provide an interface for configuring an election ballot, and then generating the ballot based on that configuration. The ballot displays in a separate window, and assembles itself based on the options set by the creator part of the program.</p>

<h4>Examples in Code:</h4>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th id="class">Class/Interface</th>
		<th id="description">Description</th>
		<th id="links">Links</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td headers="class">Ballot</td>
		<td headers="description">The base class for the generated ballot, which parses the configuration data to determine how to be assembled.</td>
		<td headers="links"><a href="https://github.com/craigmiller160/BallotProgram/blob/master/src/ballot/Ballot.java">Source</a>
	</tr>
